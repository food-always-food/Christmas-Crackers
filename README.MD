# Christmas Cracker Jokes
### A Django project to entertain during the holidays
---
This is a simple little django project that gives a joke in a "question and answer" format at the press of a button. It's also got a "Trivia" section as well.
It's simply using bootstrap and has been made to be best viewed on a mobile screen allowing you to use it at the dinner table.

More info to come when I have a moment to update the readme.
